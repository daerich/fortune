## Fortune.rb - fortune in Ruby
__Fortune.rb is a small script I wrote do display
the bundled wisdom of UNIX at the start of every
tty session__

### Copying
__I blatantly copied the `datfiles/` from [fortune-mod](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod) as well as FreeBSD -
of course the license is included__

_I may add my own fruits of wisdom later_
